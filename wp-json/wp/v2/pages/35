From understanding requirements, identifying constraints, intentional choice of tools, and follow through on deliverables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading bottom-border\">Preparation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The preparation of this project happened in three major phases: understanding the requirements, choosing tools, and learning to use the chosen technologies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My process for understanding the requirements involved exploring the company&#8217;s existing websites to gain a feel for what the existing solution is like, and explore possible needs in the future, as well as leveraging Artificial Intelligence tools to organize the provided meeting notes. I used NotebookLM to quickly summarize the meeting notes and ensure I did not miss any key information, as well as bounce ideas for how I might show I align with your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I chose my tools with care. I initially planned on a web framework I am already familiar with, but after consideration chose to learn to use WordPress in order to align better with our discussion, and to learn a new technology. NotebookLM was the primary AI tool I used for it&#8217;s ability to consume documents and use them as context for answers, allowing accurate summaries of critical information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NotebookLM I primarily learned through exploration of the available tools, and experience through providing documents and prompting the AI directly. It was an invaluable tool and something that will be integrated into my learning workflow in the future. I learned WordPress through a mix of prompting AI, the integrated tutorials, and web documentation. While I did not become an expert over a weekend, I have learned a lot about how WordPress operates, and have a much better understanding of it&#8217;s capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading bottom-border\">Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Development was largely contained within the WordPress tool itself. It has most of the tools for a static site like this one and needed only minor custom styles to get the desired outcome. NotebookLM was used regularly throughout the development process to refine my understanding of the goals and keep me going in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading bottom-border\">Deployment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I chose to deploy this as a static site hosted on GitHub, as opposed to a full WordPress stack on a dedicated web server, due largely to the nature of the project. Static site hosting aligned well with the simple nature of the site itself, and the low cost and short term nature of the project as a whole. This was an intentional choice to maximize my productivity, limiting unnecessary tools, which allowed me to deploy an entire website despite the relatively small scope of the project.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This site is built as a practical demonstration and presentation of how I approach new systems.
