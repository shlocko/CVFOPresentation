This might cover topics like ensuring the data presented on your websites is kept up to date and any bugs or issues are proactively looked for and resolved. Having someone dedicated to these tasks will help ensure smooth maintenance into the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other short term opportunities might have to do with your existing CRM workflows. While a more comprehensive overhaul of these systems will take more time commitment, other more immediate improvements can be developed such as adding automation to actions that are currently manually executed, or enhancing reporting in a way team members can utilize more effectively. Additionally, AI tools can help greatly with some repetitive tasks as well as organizing large quantities of information. While these tools often need human oversight, used responsibly they can enhance productivity significantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading bottom-border\">Example of a Maintenance Opportunity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While preparing for this presentation I was exploring your existing website to gain a greater understanding of your business and learn how the site works under typical use. During normal interactions with the site, I noticed a specific action that consistently causes unusually high CPU usage and slowly increasing memory usage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to reproduce the behavior in multiple browsers on multiple devices. This sort of behavior can cause issues with site stability and noticeable performance impact for users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I documented my observations carefully and would be happy to share the details or walk through them in a controlled setting if that would be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading bottom-border\">Medium Term<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Medium term opportunities are harder to predict from my current position and will likely require more significant time commitment. These consist of things like a more total website overhaul. You mentioned explicitly that you were not happy with your current web provider, and replacing those systems with something more centralized and easier to maintain will take time. This will also lead to significant benefits in terms of time spent on maintenance and overall UX for team members and clients alike. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, CRM workflows can benefit from longer term projects. This may take the form of designing systems to bring more synchronicity to the CRM systems and help reduce possible current or future fragmentation, as well as long term reports and historical data analysis. While these solutions might look different in Zoho compared to Redtail, the better your tools work together the smoother the experience will be for you and your clients. As I learn your existing workflows, medium term opportunities will become more viable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Short Term Short term opportunities are things I consider &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221; in the way that they should be achievable in the reasonably short term, without major technological rework of your current systems.
